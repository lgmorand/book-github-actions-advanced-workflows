This panel allows the app to generate fake entries to reach 40hrs of tracking per week.
The different values are for you to decide how you want to split these fake entries

{{< /tab >}}

This screen will help you to create categories in Outlook in the right format. Instead of using "opportunity" and tracking on a random one, you can specify the real oppty. This screen list all the oppties from MSX in which you are in the deal team.

## Colors

The colors are **not** customizable but they are the same that the ones you put in your Outlook. Every time you start the application, it get the colors from your Outlook and define them as a "theme" for the TimeTracker application in order to help you to compare both apps.
