### Ask for alias

When you start the application for the first time, it will ask for your Microsoft alias (i.e. "lomorand"). That's the only field the application cannot guess and needs to be provided.

### Sync categories

Once done, it will connect to your Outlook to create the missing categories. Because only taggued meetings are relevant, you'll need to tag your meetings with relevant categories and **restart the app**.

### Tagging meetings

In Outlook tag your meetings:

### Restart the application

The application should never ask you alias again and should properly load all data and offer to track elements.
